        My experience with building websites goes back to 2006 when I taught myself basic HTML and Photoshop to build simple websites with freewebs.com and aesthetic Myspace layouts for myself and my friends. Right from the get-go, I was hooked and knew that I wanted to go to college to be a web developer. Fast forward to 2012, and I began attending college to pursue my true passion: <span class="highlight"><b>music.</b></span> 
        <br>
        <br>
        I attended the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh and received degrees in Percussion Performance and Music Business. However, I continued to work on graphic design and web design projects on the side, mostly for myself and for the bands that I played drums in.
        <br>
        <br>
        After moving to <span class="highlight"><b>Nashville</b></span> in 2016, I worked in the e-commerce department of a record label and music distribution company, helping with the operations and graphic design for ArkivMusic.com and ArkivJazz.com. I also built and maintained Shopify stores for George Clinton/Parliament Funkadelic, Marilyn Manson, Ghost, Local Natives, Manchester Orchestra, Andrew Bird, St. Vincent, and Sylvan Esso. I currently work for a Sony Music Entertainment-owned company helping with web design and e-commerce operations for a large number of clients, including Andy Grammer, Matthew West, The Revivalists, and Sara Evans.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’ve been honing my skills as a <span class="highlight"><b>Front-End Web Developer</b></span> and have experience working with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I’m continuing to research and implement new languages, libraries, and frameworks and I’m having a lot of fun doing it! 
        <br>
        <br>
        During my free time you can find me drumming around Nashville, losing horribly at Fortnite, or spending all of my hard-earned dollars at <a href="https://jenis.com/"><span class="highlight"><b>Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams.</b></span></a>
