# portfoliosite
My official web dev portfolio site! 

My goal was to get a portfolio site up and running as quickly as possible, so for now it's a static site utilizing only HTML and CSS.
I also tried out the CSS framework, Bulma, and I loved using it! I'm definitely a fan and like it a bit more than Bootstrap.

In future updates, I plan to give some elements an overhaul and make them a bit more interactive and aesthetically pleasing using Javascript.
